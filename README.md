# company-stock-data
In this project we have taken data from two JSON files in which one stores different companies data and other stock price over different period. This is basic example of how to use jqxGrid and highcharts to display grid and chart respectively.

The content of the folder is as follows :

1.) table.html which contains the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the project. Please open the HTML file Firefox only because Chrome doesn't support local file without being served by a web server.

2.) Click on the HDFC Bank (name) in the Name column to see the stock price distribution.

3.) To separate JSON files from you testData.txt to read data.

4.) Js folder contains the required javascript for the project. There is two CDN script also used from charts and SVG, so, please be connected to the internet while opening the HTML file.

5.) CSS folder contains the required css.
